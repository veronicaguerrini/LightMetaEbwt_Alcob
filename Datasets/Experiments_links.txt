Datasets used to do experiments contain both reads and genomes. 

### Reads

The sets of paired end reads we used for experiments are downloadable from [http://www.gardner-binflab.org/lindgreen-et-al-metagenomics-benchmark-data/], and were designed ad hoc for a benchmarking analysis of metagenomic tools by reproducing the size, complexity and characteristics of real metagenomic samples. Moreover, each dataset was designed to include a subset of simulated shuffled reads as negative control in order to test the reliability of the tools.

For our experiments, we selected setA2 and setB2, and we modified the content of each fasta file as follows. 

First, we took out the random shuffled reads creating two negative control sets of reads, setA2ran and setB2ran -- titles of shuffled random reads are in files title_setA2ran.txt.gz and title_setB2ran.txt.gz, respectively. Then, we 

Second, we removed a group of reads associated with the phylum of Eukaryotes whose species provenance was not specified. In addition, we preferred not to include in our datasets a group of reads associated with $3$ genomes whose entries in the NCBI database are expiring for being obsolete or incorrect. Our sets of reads setA2 and setB2 thus contain around 20 millions of sequences belonging to $17$ different phyla and $686$ species.
The complete list of reads taken into account in setA2 and setB2 is partitioned in files title_setA2_part_.gz* and title_setB2_part_.gz*, respectively -- to decompress them
