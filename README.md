# LightMetaEbwt 

LightMetaEbwt is a new lightweight alignment-free and assembly-free framework for metagenomic classification that compares each unknown sequence in the sample to a collection of known genomes.

Takes in input:
- the (extended) Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (multi-string BWT)
- the longest common prefix array 
- the document array 

of a very large collection {\em S} of strings including both reads and genomes. The required data structures can be obtained by running BCR [https://github.com/giovannarosone/BCR_LCP_GSA] on input the fasta file of the entire collection.

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/veronicaguerrini/LightMetaEbwt
cd LightMetaEbwt-master
```

```sh
./install.sh
```


### Run

```sh
 ./to do
```

### Example
```sh
./to do
```
