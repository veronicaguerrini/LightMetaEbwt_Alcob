# LightMetaEbwt (Lightweight Metagenomic Classification via eBWT)

LightMetaEbwt is a new lightweight alignment-free and assembly-free framework for metagenomic classification that compares each unknown sequence in the sample to a collection of known genomes.

Takes in input:
- the (extended) Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (multi-string BWT)
- the longest common prefix array 
- the document array 
of a very large collection of strings. 
and it can be obtained by BCR [https://github.com/giovannarosone/BCR_LCP_GSA]

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/veronicaguerrini/LightMetaEbwt
cdLightMetaEbwt-master
```
Open parameters.h file and, please, set the parameters (data structured that must be computed, types, and so on...).
```sh
./to do
```


### Run
```sh
 ./to do
```

### Example
```sh
./to do
```
